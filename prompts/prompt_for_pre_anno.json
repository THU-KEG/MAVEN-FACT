Then, look for contextual cues like words that suggest attempts, such as 'try to' or 'seek to', and words indicating possibility, such as 'may' or 'might'. These events will also be labeled OT.\n 3. Events with indicators in the context, such as words conveying negative cues like 'stop' or 'prevent', will also be labeled OT.\n 4.If at this stage, you still cannot determine the factual certainty of an event, prioritize labeling it as OT.\n\n",
