**Task Description:**

You are given a list of tokens representing a sentence containing an event. The event is marked with `<{factuality}>` and `</{factuality}>`, where `factuality` indicates the factuality of the event. The possible values for factuality are:
- CT+ (certainly happened)
- CT- (certainly did not happen)
- PS+ (possibly happened)
- PS- (possibly did not happen)

Your task is to generate an output list similar to a Named Entity Recognition (NER) output. Each element in the output list should correspond to an element in the token list. Use the following tags:
- 'O' for tokens that are not part of an evidential basis.
- 'B' for the beginning of an evidential basis.
- 'I' for the inside of an evidential basis.

For example:

**Input:**
```python list
['Webster', "'s", 'confession', 'did', 'not', '<CT->', 'match', '</CT->', 'the', 'forensic', 'evidence', '.']
```
**Output:**
```python list
['O', 'O', 'O', 'B', 'I', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O']
```
In this case, the event is "match", its factuality is "CT-", and the evidential basis is "did not".

If there are multiple evidential basis words in a sentence, mark each appropriately. For example:

**Input:**
```python list
['Neither', 'damages', 'nor', '<CT->', 'fatalities', '</CT->', 'were', 'reported', 'during', 'that', 'time', '.']
```
**Output:**
```python list
['B', 'O', 'B', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O']
```
In this case, the event is "fatalities", its factuality is "CT-", and the evidential basis is "neither" and "nor".

**Instructions:**

1. Carefully analyze the input sentence and identify the event marked by `<{factuality}>` and `</{factuality}>`.
2. Identify the evidential basis words that support the factuality of the event.
3. Generate the output list with 'O', 'B', and 'I' tags according to the given rules.


Ensure your output matches the format and corresponds accurately to the input token list.
